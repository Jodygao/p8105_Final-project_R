<p>“A Holistic Perspective on Public Health and Personal Wellness Among
the Obese Population in the U.S” Project Report</p>
<p>Group members: Yuandi Gao(yg2907) Yi Li(yl5214) Yingting
Zhang(yz4434) Ruohan Hong(rh3132) Shiqi Wu (sw3737)</p>
<p>P8105 Data Sciences</p>
<p>Motivation The increasing prevalence of obesity cases in the United
States is becoming a serious public health issue and bringing up lots of
adverse comorbidities. The problem that comes with obesity exists not
just on an individual level but is more troublesome as it can lead to
substantial effects on the overall healthcare system’s performance and
affect economies across the country. When we talk about obesity
nowadays, we can not stop thinking of the burden that associated with
it. According to a National Survey published by Forbes Health, between
2017 and 2020, around 41.9% of adults in the United States were obese1.
With almost half of the adults being obese, Obesity was considered a
national epidemic. Concerns like chronic diseases, type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular conditions, and certain forms of cancer, that are linked
with obesity, can easily lead to heightened mortality rates and
diminished quality of life. The causes of obesity are diverse and
complex2, involving genetics, societal, and environmental factors but
addressing this public health problem and educating the importance of
personal wellness among the obese population in the U.S. is in urgent
need.</p>
<p>Related work/Inspiration The inspiration for this project comes from
a small observation and pure curiosity. Although it has always been
acknowledged that obesity prevalence is very high in the U.S., it can
have many adverse health effects on one’s overall health and well-being,
our awareness of obesity as a health issue was still initially
superficial. However, it deepened significantly this semester. For most
of us in the group, we have a class running from 5:30-8:30 PM. By the
time we finish the class, what we rely on is McDonald’s, primarily due
to its distance to the campus, low price, and is the one that still
opens at that time of the day. This routine exposure to fast food
changed our way of understanding obesity’s impacts on the public since
we constantly see people with big body images consuming fast food in
McDonald’s. The observation led to curiosity and we wonder about the
health consequences of fast-food consumption and the impact of
obesity.</p>
<p>Initial questions Primary Questions: How does the frequency of fast
food consumption relate to the Body Mass Index (BMI) of individuals in
the U.S.? Is there a significant correlation between the consumption of
frozen fast food and BMI? How does sedentary activity impact BMI, and
what is the extent of this impact? Evolution of Questions: As we dig
deeper into the project and go into the data analysis section, the
initial questions evolved to accommodate the complexities of dietary
habits and lifestyle choices. The simple correlation between fast food
consumption and BMI was expanded to include other variables like
physical inactivity. The inadequacy of finding significant results in
the initial models led to a deeper exploration of other contributing
factors. This shift prompted a broader approach to understanding the
multifaceted nature of obesity. Emerging Questions: Given the
nonsignificant findings in the initial models, new questions emerged:
Are there other dietary or lifestyle factors, beyond fast food
consumption and physical inactivity, that significantly contribute to
obesity? Analysis Driven Questions(For us to consider later): During the
data analysis, our group also brought up questions about the
effectiveness of existing public health strategies in combating obesity.
We still see lots of news and articles saying the prevalence rate
increasing, but not much mentioning the success of any interventions.
What are the gaps in current approaches, and how can they be addressed
more holistically? How can we use the analysis we did and the website we
made to form public health policy changes, for it to better tackle the
root causes of obesity, considering the complex interplay of individual,
societal, and environmental factors?</p>
<p>Data Data Source Description. The 2017–March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Data
Files for this study are sourced from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), which is an ongoing series of studies
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the civilian
noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The NHANES data collection
involves interviews and physical examinations, covering a wide range of
health and nutrition-related topics. The data is critical for the
assessment of public health and nutrition and aids in the development of
health policies and research. Special weighting measures have been
applied to the combined dataset to ensure that it reflects the
population and health trends accurately for nationally representative
estimates. Data Collection Methodology Primary Sampling Units (PSUs).
The survey utilizes a multistage probabilistic sampling design. In the
first stage, PSUs are selected based on stratification by various health
and demographic characteristics. Each PSU is typically a county or a
group of contiguous counties. Stratification. States are categorized
into health groups according to health index values. PSUs are further
divided into major strata within each health group, which are determined
by the urban-rural population distribution and other locality
characteristics. Sampling Periods. The 2017-2018 and 2019-March 2020
cycles were based on different 4-year sample designs, with PSUs selected
annually from their respective strata. Representativeness. The
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file includes PSUs from the 2017-2018
cycle and 2019-March 2020 data collection. The combined dataset was
calibrated to ensure national representativeness according to the
2015-2018 sample design, accounting for changes in population size and
other characteristics that determine major stratum membership. Data
Cleaning We first import three files by creating the data import
function (import_df) that reads the data from an .XPT file format. The
four datasets that were merged were: Demographic Variables and Sample
Weights (P_DEMO), Body Measures (P_BMX), Physical Activity (P_PAQ)
andDiet Behavior &amp; Nutrition (P_DBQ). Using a full join on the
‘SEQN’ column to merge the datasets. Then, we select the specific column
that are meaningful in the process of analysis: SEQN, RIAGENDR,
RIDAGEYR, DMDMARTZ, INDFMPIR, RIDRETH3, DMDEDUC2, PAD680, BMXBMI,
DBD900, and DBD910. Next, we did the data filtering by filtering out
specific values from various column (e.g., ‘77’, ‘99’, ‘.’, ‘7777’,
‘9999’). This step removed the missing, unknown, and null value from the
dataset and only kept those meaningful values in the dataset.
Furthermore, we rename the columns to more descriptive names like
‘gender’, ‘age’, ‘marital_status’, etc. After this step, we use the
mutate function to transform and categorize several columns: gender:
Categorizing and converting to a factor. marital_status, race,
education: Categorizing different demographic details. obese: Creating a
new variable based on BMI, categorizing individuals as ‘normal’ or
‘obese’. The variables in the Final dataset are listed below:
<code>SEQN</code> : Respondent sequence number <code>gender</code>:
Female or male <code>age</code>: Age in years at screening
<code>marital_status</code>: never married, married,
widowed/divorced/separated <code>income_to_poverty</code>: ratio of
family income to poverty <code>race</code>: Mexican American, White,
Black, Other Hispanic <code>bmi</code>: Body Mass Index (kg/m**2)
<code>freq_fast_food</code>: number of meals from fast food or pizza
place <code>freq_frozen</code>: Numbers of frozen meals/pizza in past 30
days <code>sedentary_activity</code>: Minutes sedentary activity
<code>obese</code>: normal, obese The process effectively cleans and
transforms the data, preparing it for analysis related to obesity. The
use of case_match and case_when for categorizing data is particularly
efficient, as it allows for more readable and interpretable data. This
structured approach ensures the dataset is clean, well-organized, and
ready for further statistical analysis or visualization.</p>
<p>Exploratory Analysis Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory
statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major
changes to your ideas.</p>
<p>Interpretation: The bar chart displays the prevalence of obesity
across different racial categories, differentiated by gender. It shows
that the White population has the highest count of obesity cases, with a
notable number of cases in both genders. The Black population follows,
with females being higher than males, whereas the “Other Hispanic”
categories have the lowest count of obesity cases.</p>
<p>Interpretation: The histogram indicates that obesity is present
across all age groups, with a relatively uniform distribution from young
adulthood to late middle age. There’s a significant peak in obesity
cases among individuals in their late 50s to early 60s. After this peak,
the number of obese individuals declines sharply for those in the older
age groups. Interpretation: The box plot shows the distribution of the
income to poverty ratio among obese individuals. The data is spread
across a range of ratios, mostly concentrated between 1 and 4, with the
median around 2. This suggests that individuals with obesity come from a
range of economic backgrounds, but there’s a tendency towards lower
income to poverty ratios.</p>
<p>Interpretation: The majority of recorded sedentary activity times for
both normal and obese BMI categories are clustered around the lower end
of the activity scale. This suggests that shorter periods of sedentary
activity are more common among the participants regardless of BMI
category.</p>
<p>The normal BMI category (red bars) generally has a higher count
across most bins of sedentary activity compared to the obese category
(cyan bars), indicating that there are more instances of people with
normal BMI in the dataset. Both normal and obese categories show a
decrease in count as the minutes of sedentary activity increase.
However, this decrease appears to be more gradual for the normal BMI
category and more pronounced for the obese BMI category, especially
after around 500 minutes of sedentary activity where the counts are very
low. There are very few instances of extremely high sedentary activity
(approaching 1000 minutes) for either BMI category. These observations
could suggest several things, such as a possible correlation between
lower amounts of sedentary activity and normal BMI, and vice versa.
Statistical Analysis Analysis of the relationship between fast food
consumption and BMI: First, we used the crossv_mc function to create 100
Monte Carlo cross-validation splits of the obesity dataset. This
approach helps in assessing the model’s performance more robustly by
training and testing it on different subsets of the data. Then, we
constructed three different models including a fast-food variable as the
predictor and log(bmi) as the outcome for each training set to decide
which model was best fit. Three models are listed below
model_fast_crude: A simple linear regression model with log(bmi) as the
response variable and freq_fast_food as the predictor.
model_fast_adjusted: An adjusted linear regression model including
freq_fast_food and other covariates like age, gender, marital status,
race, education, and income_to_poverty. model_fast_inter: An interaction
model considering interactions between freq_fast_food and variables such
as education and income_to_poverty, along with the main effects of these
predictors. Model Performance Evaluation After the computation of the
RMSE for each model on their test dataset, the violin plot was made for
visualization purposes. This plot helps in comparing the distribution of
RMSEs across the model. Furthermore, we look at the summary of the
Best-Fitting Model. We extracted and printed the summary of the adjusted
model, which is the best model from the previous step. This summary
includes beta coefficients and p-values. Then, we do the residual
analysis for the adjusted Model. A plot of residuals versus fitted
values for the best_model_fast (adjusted model) was created. This plot
is crucial for diagnosing model fit, as it helps in identifying patterns
in the residuals that might suggest problems with the model, such as
non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p><code>fast_adjusted</code> model has a lower median with most of its
data concentrated at the lower end of the rmse scale, which suggests
better predictive performance for most of its predictions compared to
the other models. The model <code>fast_adjusted</code> seems to be the
best model overall due to its concentration of lower rmse values,
although <code>fast_inter</code> may also perform similarly well for the
majority of predictions but has some predictions with high error.
Best-Fitting Model Analysis</p>
<p>The estimated <code>log(BMI)</code> is approximately 3.414 when all
predictor variables are held at zero. To interpret this on the original
BMI scale, you would calculate exp(3.414). This value represents the
estimated BMI for the baseline categories of all categorical predictors
(usually the most common or reference category) and zero for continuous
predictors. The coefficient for consumption of the number of meals from
fast food or pizza place is positive (0.00264) and statistically
significant. To interpret the effect on the original BMI scale, consider
that a small increase in the <code>log(BMI)</code> corresponds to a
percentage increase in BMI. Specifically, for each one-unit increase in
fast food consumption, the log(BMI) is expected to increase by 0.0026372
kg/m^2. Similarly, for other continuous predictors like age, the
coefficient represents the percentage change in log(BMI) for a one-unit
increase in that predictor. For categorical predictors like gender,
marital status, and race, the coefficients represent the percentage
difference in log(BMI) compared to the reference category. The
<code>R-squared</code> value (0.02777) indicates that about 2.777% of
the variability in log-transformed BMI is explained by the model. While
this might seem low, it’s not uncommon in behavioral and social science
research where many unmeasured factors can influence the outcome. The
significance of the coefficients suggests that these factors have a
statistically significant association with BMI. However, the magnitude
of these effects might be small, especially for variables like age,
education and income_to_poverty ratio. The significant predictors in the
model, like
<code>freq_fast_food</code>,<code>gender</code>,<code>race</code>
indicate factors that are associated with <code>BMI</code>. However, the
small R-squared value suggests that many other factors not included in
the model also influence <code>BMI</code>. Given that the response
variable is log-transformed, the interpretation is in terms of
percentage change (for continuous predictors) or relative percentage
difference (for categorical predictors) in BMI. Residual Analysis</p>
<p>The variance of residuals increasing with the fitted values suggests
that the model might benefit from a transformation of variables or the
inclusion of additional predictors to stabilize the variance across the
range of predictions. The curvature in the LOESS line could imply that
the model is missing some complexity of the relationship, which might be
addressed with non-linear terms or interaction terms in the model.
Conclusion Overall, this residual plot indicates that while the model
might be performing adequately, there is room for improvement in terms
of accounting for non-constant variance and potentially non-linear
relationships.</p>
<p>Analysis of the relationship between sedentary activity and BMI: This
model’s aim is to understand how sedentary activity potentially
influences BMI when controlling for demographic and socioeconomic
factors. Histogram for Sedentary Activity</p>
<p>Sedentary activity with log(BMI) - Cross-validation Results In the
context of these models, a lower RMSE indicates a more accurate
prediction of BMI from the predictors used in the model.</p>
<p>The cross-validation results show that the mean RMSE for the adjusted
and inter (interaction) models are both 0.235, while the crude model has
a slightly higher RMSE of 0.237. In this case, both the adjusted and
inter-models perform slightly better than the crude model, as indicated
by their lower RMSE values, which means they are, on average, closer to
the true BMI values when log-transformed.</p>
<p>A valid reason we chose the adjusted model over the inter-model,
despite having the same RMSE, could be its simplicity and
interpretability. The adjusted model includes additional covariates
(age, gender, marital status, race, education, and income-to-poverty
ratio) that are expected to be related to BMI based on previous research
or theoretical considerations. Including these covariates allows the
model to account for more variability in BMI that is explained by these
factors.</p>
<p>Moreover, while interaction terms in the inter-model may capture the
combined effects of sedentary activity with other variables, they can
make the model more complex and harder to interpret. We proceed the
model statistics in the adjusted model for sedentary activity. Violin
plot: model_type</p>
<p>Interpretation of the Adjusted model (Sedentary Ativity) Coefficients
Interpretation on Log Scale: Intercept: The estimated log(BMI) is
approximately 3.366 when all predictor variables are held at zero. To
interpret this on the original BMI scale, you would calculate
exp(3.366). This value represents the estimated BMI for the baseline
categories of all categorical predictors (usually the most common or
reference category) and zero for continuous predictors.</p>
<p>Sedentary Activity: The coefficient for sedentary activity is
positive (0.0001905) and statistically significant. This suggests that
for each unit increase in sedentary activity, the log(BMI) increases by
this amount. To interpret the effect on the original BMI scale, consider
that a small increase in the log(BMI) corresponds to a percentage
increase in BMI. Specifically, a one-unit increase in sedentary activity
is associated with approximately a 0.01905% increase in BMI.</p>
<p>Predict log(BMI) using the adjusted model</p>
<p>Other Predictors: Similarly, for other continuous predictors like
age, the coefficient represents the percentage change in BMI for a
one-unit increase in that predictor. For categorical predictors like
gender, marital status, and race, the coefficients represent the
percentage difference in BMI compared to the reference category.</p>
<p>Model Fit and R-squared: The R-squared value (0.06851) indicates that
about 6.851% of the variability in log-transformed BMI is explained by
the model. While this might seem low, it’s not uncommon in behavioral
and social science research, where many unmeasured factors can influence
the outcome.</p>
<p>Statistical Significance: The significance of the coefficients
suggests that these factors have a statistically significant association
with BMI. However, the magnitude of these effects might be small,
especially for variables like age and income_to_poverty ratio.</p>

<p>Overall Interpretation: The significant predictors in the model, like
sedentary activity and gender, indicate factors that are associated with
BMI. However, the small R-squared value suggests that many other factors
not included in the model also influence BMI. Given that the response
variable is log-transformed, the interpretation is in terms of
percentage change (for continuous predictors) or relative percentage
difference (for categorical predictors) in BMI.</p>
<p>Analysis of the relationship between frozen food consumption and BMI:
This model’s aim is to understand how frozen food consumption
potentially influences BMI when controlling for demographic and
socioeconomic factors. I first started generating 100 Monte Carlo
cross-validation splits of the obesity dataset. By doing so, I was able
to evaluate the model’s predictive performance across various subsets of
the data, thereby providing a more reliable assessment of its predictive
capabilities. Three linear regression models were then used for
comparison and analysis Crude Model: ‘model_frozen_crude’ includes only
the frequency of frozen fast food consumption as a predictor for
log-transformed BMI. Adjusted Model: ‘model_frozen_adjusted’ adjusts for
additional covariates, including age, gender, marital status, race,
education, and income-to-poverty ratio. Interaction Model:
‘model_frozen_inter’ includes interaction terms between frozen fast food
frequency and socioeconomic factors such as education and
income-to-poverty ratio, alongside the main effects. Model Performance
Evaluation According to the violin plot of the RMSE distribution for
each model, the adjusted model consistently shows a concentrated
distribution of lower RMSE values, meaning it has a superior predictive
performance relative to the crude and interaction models. This
observation is confirmed by the summary of cross-validation results,
which indicates that the adjusted model has the lowest mean RMSE of
0.243, compared to 0.309 for the crude model and 0.336 for the
interaction model. Since lower values mean better model performance, the
adjusted model has the best model performance among these three models.
Violin plot: model_type Cross-Validation Results Best-Fitting Model
Analysis The best-fitting model, based on the cross-validation results,
is the adjusted model. Thus, a detailed examination was conducted, and
its summary statistics indicate that: The Intercept is estimated at
3.409 on the log scale. The coefficient for frozen fast food frequency
is -4.291e-06 with a p-value of 0.86427, this suggests that the number
of frozen fast food meals consumed does not have a statistically
significant effect on BMI in this model. Other covariates, such as
gender and race, show significant associations with BMI, with gender
(Male) and race (Other) showing a strong negative association with BMI.
The R-squared value of 0.03455 indicates that approximately 3.455% of
the variability in the log-transformed BMI is explained by the model.
Residual Analysis The residuals plot against fitted values provides
insight into the adequacy of the model fit. The presence of a random
scatter of residuals around the horizontal line at zero suggests no
obvious issues with non-linearity or heteroscedasticity. However, the
slight curvature in the LOESS line and the increasing spread of
residuals at higher fitted values could imply potential model
misspecification or the need for a variable transformation to address
heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p>Conclusion Overall, our analysis suggests that while frozen fast food
consumption frequency does not significantly predict BMI, other factors
such as gender and race do have significant associations. The small
R-squared value implies that other unmeasured factors also play a role
in influencing BMI, which are not captured by this model. The relatively
stable variance in residuals suggests that the linear model is a
reasonable fit for the data, although there is room for improvement.
Future modeling efforts might explore the inclusion of non-linear terms,
additional interaction terms, or other predictor variables to enhance
the model’s explanatory power. Data Visualization Initial exploratory
data analysis involved visualizing the distribution of sedentary
activity within the study population. Histogram and density plots
revealed the spread and central tendency of sedentary activity levels,
which is crucial for identifying the range of sedentary behaviors in the
dataset. Regression Analysis A robust statistical approach was employed
to predict BMI, operationalized through a natural logarithmic
transformation to achieve normalization. Three distinct models were
constructed to analyze the relationship: Crude Model: A simple linear
regression with sedentary activity as the sole predictor. Adjusted
Model: An extended model incorporating covariates such as age, gender,
marital status, race, education, and income-to-poverty ratio.
Interaction Model: A sophisticated model considering the interaction
between sedentary activity and covariates like education and
income-to-poverty ratio. Each model was rigorously tested using a
100-fold cross-validation procedure to ensure the stability and
reliability of our findings. Model Comparison and Selection The
comparison of cross-validation results revealed a slightly superior
performance of the adjusted and interaction models over the crude model,
indicated by marginally lower RMSE values (0.235 vs. 0.237). These
results support the hypothesis that sedentary activity and BMI are
linked, and this association is influenced by the included covariates.
The choice of the adjusted model was driven by its balance of complexity
and interpretability, as it significantly accounts for more variability
in BMI while remaining comprehensible. Model Statistics The regression
coefficients from the adjusted model provide insight into the
relationship between each predictor and BMI: Sedentary Activity: A
positive and significant relationship with BMI, though the effect size
is relatively small. Gender: Being male is associated with a lower BMI
compared to females. Marital Status: Being never married or
widowed/divorced/separated shows different associations with BMI
compared to being married. Race: The category ‘Other’ is significantly
associated with lower BMI compared to the reference group. Education:
Attaining some college or AA degree is associated with a higher BMI
compared to the reference education level. The R-squared value of
0.06094, although modest, is not uncommon in behavioral sciences,
indicating that other factors not included in the model also influence
BMI. Residual Analysis The residual plot for the interaction model was
evaluated, revealing a random scatter of residuals around the zero line
with no apparent systematic pattern, indicating a good fit for the
model. The blue LOESS curve is relatively flat and centered around the
horizontal red dashed line, which further corroborates the model’s
appropriateness. Detailed Interpretation The coefficients obtained
through regression analysis must be interpreted in the context of a
log-transformed dependent variable. For instance, the coefficient for
sedentary activity (0.0001753) suggests that for each additional unit of
sedentary activity, there is a corresponding 0.01753% increase in BMI,
holding other variables constant. This nuanced interpretation is vital
for understanding the true impact of sedentary behavior on BMI.</p>
<p>Discussion Our findings underscored the significant, albeit modest,
influence of sedentary behavior, on BMI when adjusted for demographic
and socioeconomic factors. The adjusted model’s efficacy in capturing
this relationship provides a compelling narrative about the subtle yet
impactful role of lifestyle choices on personal health metrics such as
BMI.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the linear regression analysis for fast food emphasizes
that the positive and statistically significant coefficient for fast
food consumption underscores the importance of dietary habits in
influencing BMI. While the effect size of fast food consumption on BMI
may seem small, over time or across a population, even small increases
in BMI can have substantial health implications. This analysis could
have a profound influence on policy and the health field. For instance,
the result could inform interventions aimed at reducing fast food
consumption as part of a strategy to combat obesity.</p>
<p>These insights carry significant implications for public health
initiatives. They emphasize the necessity of addressing sedentary
lifestyles and consumption of fast food as part of obesity intervention
strategies. Moreover, the disparities highlighted by demographic
variables like gender and race call for tailored approaches that
consider the socio-cultural dimensions of health.</p>
<p>The nuanced understanding gleaned from our analysis can inform health
policies and programs, enabling them to target interventions more
effectively and contribute to the broader goal of mitigating obesity’s
prevalence and impact.</p>
<p>Limitations Despite the robust analytical framework employed, our
study is not devoid of limitations:</p>
<p>Transformation Challenges: The use of log-transformed BMI to
normalize the distribution may introduce complexities in interpretation.
The relationship between predictors and the outcome in the transformed
scale does not readily translate to the original BMI scale without
back-transformation.</p>
<p>Model’s Explained Variability: The R-squared values indicated that a
significant proportion of BMI variability remains unexplained by our
models. This suggests the presence of other influential factors not
captured in the analysis, which could range from genetic predispositions
to environmental and behavioral influences.</p>
<p>Causality Constraints: The cross-sectional nature of NHANES data
inhibits our ability to draw causal inferences. Longitudinal studies
would be required to establish causal relationships between lifestyle
factors and BMI.</p>
<p>Potential Confounders: Our models may not have accounted for all
potential confounders, such as mental health status, quality of diet,
metabolic rates, and genetic factors, which could affect the accuracy of
our conclusions.</p>
<p>Heteroscedasticity: If the log transformation did not fully correct
for heteroscedasticity, the standard errors of our estimates might be
biased, leading to unreliable confidence intervals and hypothesis
tests.</p>
<p>Clinical Relevance: The clinical relevance of a log-transformed BMI
may not be as straightforward compared to the traditional BMI categories
used in medical practice.</p>
<p>Generalizability: Our results are based on the U.S. population and
may not be generalizable to other countries or cultures due to
differences in lifestyle, diet, and genetic factors.</p>
<p>Future Directions Considering these limitations, future research
could:</p>
<p>Incorporate additional variables and potential confounders to capture
a more complete picture of the factors influencing BMI. Utilize
longitudinal data to explore the temporal dynamics of BMI changes in
relation to lifestyle factors. Apply more sophisticated statistical
techniques or machine learning algorithms to better model complex,
non-linear relationships. Extend the analysis to diverse populations to
enhance the generalizability of the findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our research contributes valuable insights into the
factors associated with BMI among the obese population in the U.S. It
lays the groundwork for more nuanced public health strategies that can
adapt to the multifaceted nature of obesity. The limitations and
potential avenues for future work highlight the ongoing need for
comprehensive research in this domain.</p>
