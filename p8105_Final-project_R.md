### Project Title

A Holistic Perspective on Public Health and Personal Wellness Among the
Obese Population in the U.S

### Project Motivation

The prevalence of obesity within the U.S. is causing multiple
comorbidities, addressing a critical and escalating public health crisis
that significantly impacts individual well-being, healthcare systems,
and economies nationwide. As obesity rates continue to rise, the burden
of associated chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular conditions, and certain forms of cancer, also increases,
leading to heightened mortality rates and diminished quality of life.

### Intended Final Products

Baseline: male/female; demographics; age; existing conditions; income;
family of household; family history; education; access to healthy foods;
physical activity. \[Obesity: BMI 30\]

- U.S nationwide demographic and prevalence

- Year to year trend of \# of obesity among U.S population-line graph

- Survival analysis (y-probability of surviving; x-year; independent
  variable: people with obesity vs.Â people without obesity)

- Regression among : male/female; demographics; age; existing
  conditions; income; family of household; family history; education;
  access to healthy foods; physical activity

- Residuals plots; multicollinearity

- Intervention, limitation, conclusion

### Anticipated data sources

We plan to pull data directly from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website, within the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey program. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection during the
2019-2020 cycle was not completed and was not representative. Therefore,
the data we use will include data from 2019 to March 2020 and data from
2017-2018 cycle for a better nationally representative. Additional
Supplemental data may also be pulled from the Kaggle website when
needed.

- NHANES 2017-March 2020
  <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2017-2020>
- Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>

### Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges

- Baseline Characteristics
- Logistic Regression: categorize based on the variables
- Linear Regression/residuals/ multicollinearity: control for
  multicollinearity.
- Which statistical test to use among analyses to generate the best-fit
  model.

### Planned timeline

- November 15: import data and cleaning data, baseline characteris
- November 20: analysis
- December 1:finish all coding and html webpage
- December 2- 7: feedback
- December 9: Report Written report giving detailed project description;
  Webpage and screencast; Webpage overview of project, with short
  explanatory video (published online)
- December 9: Peer assessment
- December 14: In-class discussion of projects
